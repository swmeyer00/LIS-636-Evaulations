<h1>LIS 636 Evaluation 2</h1>
<h2>by Steven Meyer</h2>
<p>The libraries at Columbia University in New York City consist of fifteen libraries with collections ranging from wide range of fields. These fields range from architecture, law, health and sciences, music and art, rare books and manuscripts, and journalism. For online use, all fifteen libraries are linked to one primary website: <a href="https://library.columbia.edu" alt="Columbia University Libraries link" target="_website">library.columbia.edu</a>. This website includes, in addition to hyperlinks to the Columbia's fifteen libraries, menu tabs for a wide variety of options for user needs. These include services and tools, collections, information on library use, and information about Columbia University Libraries. Other features include thumbails for user tasks, like borrowing items and asking a librarian, and sections for events and news at Columbia University. With the combination of a simple search engine, and a series of filtering options that can lead to different libraries and collections, Columbia University Libraries website is good for both academic and non-academic research among users.</p>
<p>The main components of Columbia University Libraries website include: the main search engine, the general library database system, the filtering options, and the information provided on the materials and resources by the general library database system. Columbia University's main search engine is called CLIO, which stands for Columbia Libraries Information Online. By using CLIO search engine, the user is brought straight to Columbia University's general library database, which features all materials and resources provided by all fifteen libraries. For filtering searches, the user has to select one of the format options in the menu on the left side of the database page. Formats for resources include print books, e-books, articles, periodicals, videos, films, and CDs.</p>
<p>One additional component is the Columbia University Libraries list found in the menu tab. Located inside the menu tabs at the home page, the library list features hyperlinks to all of Columbia University's fifteen libraries. Each library has a collection corresponding with a specific field of study that is taught and offered at Columbia University. As mentioned earlier, these fields range from architecture to law, to music and arts, and to rare books and manuscripts. When the user clicks on one of the hyperlinks in the libraries list, the user is forwarded to the home page of the library building's separate home page. From the library building's home page, the user can utilize the menu tabs to gain access to resources pertaining to the field of study supplied at the appropriate library building. The user can also use the repository corresponding to the field of study supplied by the library of choice. For example, if the user is looking for a book on classical music, the user can go to the music and arts library, which has a repository for materials related to music and art only. There, the user can locate materials related only to classical music without having to locate information on where the materials are supplied because of the repository being located at Columbia's music and arts library.</p>
<p>I think that Columbia University Libraries website is centered on both quick searching and filtered searching tasks. The intention of the CLIO search engine is for quick, non-complicated searching in which the keywords typed and entered in the search engine will bring the user straight to the library database system. On the contrary, the menu tab containing Columbia's fifteen libraries appears to be intended for filter searches based on topic and location. As stated earlier with the example on the music and arts library repository, a user who selects any of the fifteen libraries has the ability to specify the materials he or she wishes to search based on field of study, not just general availability. This filtering capability is good for academic and non-academic research because it helps researchers locate the resources and materials needed based on their topic of choice without having to solely rely on using the CLIO search engine, which provides broad results across all of Columbia University's fifteen libraries. The libraries menu also adds versatility to the website by providing the user the ability to explore the website both in quick searching, as found in the CLIO search engine, and filtered searching, as found in the libraries menu tab.</p>
