<h3>Website Overview</h3> 
<p>North Carolina Digital Collections is the digital library of the North Carolina Government and Heritage Library; North Carolina’s biggest government library. The website for North Carolina Digital Collections is <a href="http://digital.ncdcr.gov/" alt="North Carolina Digital Collections link" target="_website">digital.ncdcr.gov</a>. It is also accessible through the North Carolina Government and Heritage Library website. The website is designed with a grid layout containing a search engine, global navigation menu bar, browsing tables with hyperlinks to the different online collections, and the contact information and social media links. The browsing table contains hyperlinks to the various collections for users and patrons to view. The database for NC Digital Collections contains over 90,000 historic items that are culturally, politically, and socially significant to the history of North Carolina. These items range from photographs, government publications, manuscripts, and other North Carolina resources. The feature that I will analyze is the browsing feature from the NC Digital Collections page using the law of proximity.</p>
<h3>Literature Review: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228938144_The_gestalt_principles_of_similarity_and_proximity_apply_to_both_the_haptic_and_visual_grouping_of_elements" alt="The gestalt principles of similarity and proximity link" target="_website">"The gestalt principles of similarity and proximity" by Dempsey Chang, Keith Nesbitt, and Kevin Wilkins</a> </h3>
<p>In this 2007 article, Australian professors Chang Dempsey, Keith Nesbitt, and Kevin Wilkins, analyze an experiment from 2006 measuring haptic and visual groupings of elements using the Gestalt laws of similarity and proximity. The hypothesis of the experiment, according to the professors, was that people “will use touch to group display elements in the same way they group elements visually” (p. 2). In the article, the professors focused on how “individuals use the sense of touch (haptics) to group display elements using the Gestalt principles of similarity and proximity” (p. 2). The results of the experiment found that the majority of the subjects used different methods for haptic and visual groupings based on similarity and proximity of the objects. The objects with closer resemblance between other objects were organized in groups based on similar appearance and separated in proximity to other objects (p. 7). What the results indicated was that the Gestalt laws of similarity and proximity were relevant to user experience in haptics and visuals and, therefore, critical to understanding how users group different elements.</p>
<p>Chang, Nesbitt, and Wilkins provide a strong historical background about the Gestalt laws of similarity and proximity. The law of proximity was first proposed in a paper by psychologist Max Wertheimer in 1923 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3482144/" alt="A Century of Gestalt Psychology in Visual Perception I. Perceptual Grouping and Figure-Ground Organization" target="_website">(Wagemans)</a>. In his paper, Wertheimer first posed the problem of perceptual grouping by asking what stimulus factors influence the perceived grouping of discrete elements (Wagemans). Wertheimer first demonstrated that equally spaced dots do not group together into larger perceptual units, except as a uniform line and then noted that when he altered the spacing between adjacent dots so that some dots were closer than others, the closer ones grouped together strongly into pairs (Wagemans). The professors manage to incorporate the historical background with relevance to the experiment being analyzed in the article. The law of proximity is given as much attention to detail in the article as the law of similarity in which proximity is measured at the same level of importance in the results provided by Chang, Nesbitt, and Wilkins.</p>
<p>The experiment, as told in the article, demonstrated the human element of proximity. According to Smashing Magazine contributor Stephen Bradley "people perceive their entirety before we see the individual objects" <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/" alt="Design Principles: Visual Perception and the Principles of Gestalt" target="_website">(Bradley)</a>. Bradley further states that people "also see the whole as more than the sum of the parts, and even when the parts are entirely separate entities, we’ll look to group them as some whole” (Bradley). The subjects in the experiment, according to the article, tended to perceive the haptic elements in their entirety before breaking them into individual groups by proximity. The visual elements were viewed by the subjects in their whole form rather than by individual elements.</p>
<p>The experiment conducted in this article is a good example of Gestalt principles in user experience. Although the experiment was not conducted using a website, the subjects were given the task of sorting elements based on touch and visual characteristics. The experiment is also an example of using observer models, which are one of the standard quantitative tools in vision research <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698916300475" alt="An Overview of the Quantitative Approaches in Gestalt Perception" target="_website">(Jäkel)</a>; applying Gestalt laws can be seen in the observer models used by the subjects when sorting out the visual elements in the experiment. As stated earlier, the subjects tended to group the elements based on similar appearances and on proximity between the physical characteristics. User experience on website design follows a similar concept with this experiment: users are given the task of viewing a webpage and sort out the different features based on similarity and proximity. The visuals that are grouped closer together are more likely to belong within the same features compared to elements that are visually different. In conclusion, Chang, Nesbitt, and Wilkins article is a solid analysis of the laws of proximity and similarity in a user experience experiment.</p>
<h3>Analysis of Feature</h3>
<p>The NC Digital Collections webpage has two options for browsing: using the search engine, or using the browsing tabs. The menu bar above the search engine is a global navigation menu bar, which means it is displayed on every webpage on the digital collections website. The main webpage for the digital collections consist of three tables below the search engine that are “Featured Topics,” “Surprise Me,” and “Explore.” With these browsing options, the user has the option to either view the most popular topics on the collections website, receive a random collection to view, or explore the collection with filters. Below these three tables is the “Collections” table, which is the main browsing table because it contains all the digital collection topics. Each topic is sorted in alphabetical order with a short description, two tabs for browsing and information, and a thumbnail that corresponds to the topic of each collection.</p>

<p>The law of proximity states that “objects that are near, proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together” <a href="https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity.html" alt="Laws of UX: Law of Proximity" target="_website">(Laws of UX)</a>. The layout of the different topics on NC Digital Collections follows the law of proximity by placing the thumbnails and tabs close together and spaces them out evenly. It’s easy for the user to interpret the collections being displayed and to select the browsing option using the tab. Each thumbnail is high quality, and the text is not too small. The browsing tab is highlighted in orange with the name of the function in bold font. </p>
<p>The search engine is small with the option to either use the “Advanced Search” or “Go.” “Advanced Search” is for filtering search terms. When browsing for results using a keyword or term, the user will be sent to the online database page. On the database page, the thumbnails and text, containing the information for the results, are spaced out by columns with consistent measurements. Mads Soegaard of the Interaction Design Foundation, states that the law of proximity enables users to interpret text as a whole in text spacing and for different elements of text on a web page because the spaces “between blocks of text tells us how likely they are to be related to each other” <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/laws-of-proximity-uniform-connectedness-and-continuation-gestalt-principles-2" alt="Laws of Proximity, Uniform Connectedness, and Continuation - Gestalt Principles (2)" target="_website">(Soegaard)</a>. The close proximity of the text in the columns makes it easy for users to interpret the text with the appropriate result.</p>

<p>The consistent spacing between the browsing tab and the thumbnails for the different collections on the home page allow users to be more likely to gain an understanding of information faster than if the text were too small or the thumbnails not clear. According Sara Mae Sincero of Explorable, the law of proximity “relieves us from processing so many small stimuli” <a href="https://explorable.com/gestalt-laws-similarity-proximity-and-closure" alt="Gestalt Laws: Similarity, Proximity and Closure" target="_website">(Sincero)</a>. When viewing the thumbnails of the different collections on the home page, it was not difficult to group the different topics based on alphabetical order because of the consistent layout of the text and tabs. For the database page, the thumbnails are reduced in size, but remain high quality in order to enable users to see what the item looks like as displayed on the website. It was simple to differentiate the items based on the thumbnails in the database page because of the high quality of the thumbnails and the separation of the information text. The clarity of the information provided for the items were clear, accurate, and followed a consistent format.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The website for North Carolina Digital Collections is solidly designed. The browsing feature is well organized and operates smoothly for users. It utilizes the law of proximity with good execution in the collection layout, especially in regards to consistent space between text, tabs, and thumbnails. My recommendation when using this digital collection website is to browse the collections by clicking on the browsing tab, located below each collection thumbnail, first before using the search engine. Using the browsing tabs for the different collections is an effective technique for filtering results faster than using the "Advanced Search" option in the search engine. Overall, the law of proximity for North Carolina Digital Collections’ browsing feature is applied well and enables users to have a solid experience using the website.</p>
