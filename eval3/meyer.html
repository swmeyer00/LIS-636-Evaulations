<h1>LIS 636 Evaluation 3</h1>
<h2>by Steven Meyer</h2>
<p>San Francisco Public Library is one of the oldest public libraries in San Francisco, California. SF Public Library's main website is <a href="https://sfpl.org/" alt="San Francisco Public Library link" target="_website">sfpl.org</a>. The main home page of SF Public Library website consists of five tables covering the library's different services and sponsored advertisements, a menu bar for books and materials, the e-library, services, the library calendar, and library information, and an online catalog database. Materials available at SF public library include books, e-books, DVDs, and music for audiences ranging from kids, teenagers, and adults. Combining a simple layout and design with a reliable search engine, SF Public Library website is good for obtaining information on available resources at the library while providing a good set of links, menus, and online catalog database.</p>
<h3>Strategy Plane</h3>
<p>The main objective of San Francisco Public Library is not directly stated on the home page, but in the "About" section, there are one-sentence descriptions related to the different branches of the library. These one-sentence descriptions all pertain to the library's main objective, which is basically to provide a public library accessible for all users with clear and efficient services. The links and options on services for user needs are directly on the main interface of the home page. These services include getting a library card, renewing items, reserving computers, accessibility services, and job opportunities at the library. Given that San Francisco Public Library is an open source for user needs, the library's usability includes two basic methods: identify user needs, and fulfill user needs. The library has two tabs on its menu bar labeled for kids and teenagers. When clicked, the library will forward the user to a separate website, which is still under SF Public Library, containing only items related for either kids or teenagers. The purpose of these two separate websites is easy access and search for items intended for younger audiences without having to be burdened by only using the main library's catalog to find materials for young users. This purpose relates back to SF Public Library's main objective in providing clear and efficient services for user needs.</p>
<h3>Scope Plane</h3>
<p>The webpages for San Francisco Public Library contain limited text with many visuals. For example, their home page includes five tables lined up in two rows and three columns. Each table displays a different service, or advertisement, provided by the library, which is part of the library's content requirements for the home page. At the top is the library logo, menu bar, and search engine for their online catalog database. The online catalog database requires one of the three checkboxes to be checked and for the main library to be chosen from the library list found in the second table. Upcoming events sponsored by the library are advertised on the home page and are highlighted in a slideshow found in the first table. In the online catalog database, the most relevant items are placed at the top with the status of availability, with the least relevant items being shown at the bottom or on succeeding pages. In the search results, SF Public Library's database is clear in stating whether the item in search is available, on hold, or not available by using two colors located in the item's search table. Green is used for available, and orange is for hold or unavailable.</p>
<h3>Structure Plane</h3>
<p>San Francisco Public Library website employs the hierarchical structure. When contacting the library for help, the user has to either call or email the library in which a front desk staff member will assist. If the user needs the reference librarian, the front desk staff member has to forward the user's call or email to the reference librarian. The same process also applies to contacting the head librarian. The layout of the tables, menu bar, and search engine are intended for self-navigation for the user. When the user clicks on the links for services, like contacting the library's staff, the contact information for the services staff at SF Public Library will appear. The head librarian is in charge of the operations at SF Public Library. The reference librarian and the front desk staff represent services for users. The organizing principles for the library's online catalog database include organizing by name, author, language, and genre.</p>
<h3>Skeleton Plane</h3>
<p>Interface design features links, thumbnails, icons, and drop-down menus. Each link is highlighted in light blue and directly lead to the proper destination. The thumbnails also lead the user to their respective destinations based on their content. On the library catalog database page, there are lists for recent staff reading lists, reviews for recent books, DVDs, and music, and other recent material lists. These lists utilize the side-scroll feature in which the user has to click on either the dots below the thumbnails or on the arrows to view the recent lists. When using the catalog database search engine, the user will be forwarded to the checkboxes are featured on the right-hand side for filtering searches. The checkboxes are symmetrically organized, and once checked, are quick to filter the searches on the webpage. Global navigation is utilized for the menu bar, indicated with white text and a dark blue background. Regardless of which page the user views, the global navigation menu bar is always in the same location with the same drop-down menus and links. This feature helps the user have an option to go to another section of the website without having to return to the home page on every single session.</p>
<h3>Surface Plane</h3>
<p>Every page on the website has a white background. Supporting colors include blue, yellow, and gray. The design comp of the online catalog database is visually strong for users because of the color scheme is clear. The global navigation menu bar with the dark blue background, as mentioned in the skeleton plane, is difficult for users to miss. As stated earlier in the scope plane, the green and orange colors used to indicate an item's availability provides the user with a clear indicator that does not require looking solely at text to locate an item's availability. The font size for the text is formatted with a balance between small and large, and different font formats for the website's drop-down menus and pages. Images of the material, like book covers, are displayed in the search results if available. One drawback of the design comp for the website is the limited information displayed on the home page does create a learning curve for the user. Since there is not a lot of information listed in front of the user on the home page, a new user would have to explore and figure out where the links go and exactly where to locate general library information on the website.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>San Francisco Public Library website is a good tool for searching available resources at the San Francisco Public Library. The online catalog database has a good design comp and is simple for users to use. The main objective of open access for users is executed well with the online catalog database, home page tables, and global navigation menu bar. However, the small amount of information provided on the website is a setback for users who wish to understand more about the library's general information without having to locate the general information by exploring the different links found within the "About" page. The lack of available information for the head staff in charge is also a disadvantage for users who wish to contact the head librarian or reference librarian directly for assistance. Despite these drawbacks, SF Public Library website is constructed well and allows users the capability of achieving good use with it.</p>
