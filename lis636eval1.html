<p>UNCG Library, also known as Jackson Library, has one main website: the <a href="https://library.uncg.edu/" alt="UNCG Library Website link" target="_website">UNCG Library Website</a>. The basic components of the UNCG Library Website include one primary search engine, which is located in the top-center of the home page. There, the user can select between five different resource categories, ranging from all available resources, the library catalog, articles, and DVDs supplied at the UNCG Library. In addition to the five main categories, the user has the option of selecting hyperlinks to databases, journals, research guides, and course reserves to find information or resources for specific topic needs. Below the search engine are links to libraries and collections, services, and information about the library. The user also has the option to reserve spaces and room equipment inside UNCG's library.</p>
<p>I think UNCG Library's website was designed to facilitate search and locate tasks. The main search engine is placed near the top and in the center of the home page, which appears to be intended for users to start using upon entering the website. The layout of the website is divided into two parts: searching for resources, and reading information about the library and the library's services. With this layout, the website's home page is not heavily crowded with text and images that would otherwise slow down the searching process. As the home page gives the user only two primary functions, the search engine and the library's information and background, it helps users navigate the website with ease without having to click on every available tab to figure out the basic components of the website.</p> 
 <p>The basic components of the UNCG Library website include: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select format</li>
    <li>Enter keywords into search engine</li>
    <li>Filter search results by clicking on the check boxes</li>
    <li>Review results</li>
</ol>
 <p>These components of UNCG Library's website allows for users to be able to begin searching for resources without much delay. When a user enters a keyword into the search engine, the website will take the user straight to the library's database in which the user is free to explore the database and look for resources available on the library's database. The user to filter search results by checking off boxes in the filter table on the left hand side of the library database page. For example, if the user wants to look for a resource as a print copy, the user can check off the "Print" checkbox in the filter table. Within seconds, the search results will display only print copies related to the resource in the search engine. This filter table provides the user with the ability to manage searches as it eliminates the need to type keywords specifying resource formats in the search engine. </p>
 <p>The UNCG Library website is simple and well-balanced between searching and locating information and resources. The simple layout of the home page is welcoming for new users, especially for new students at UNCG, to learn how to find resources available at UNCG Library. With the formats of resources separated by different tabs and hyperlinks, users can navigate the library online with ease. The filter boxes allow quick and simple search and locating tasks for users looking for resources in almost any format. In conclusion, the UNCG Library website is a good library website for students, faculty, staff, and off-campus users.</p>
